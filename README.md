This task is to Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices
Collect a large dataset of food images. Datasets such as Food-101, Food-50, and others can be useful.
Annotate the images with labels identifying the food items.
Normalize the images (e.g., resizing to a standard size, scaling pixel values).
Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture such as ResNet, Inception, or EfficientNet.
Create a mapping between recognized food items and their calorie content.
Use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on your dataset.
Use the recognized food items to predict calorie content.
Evaluate the food recognition model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Develop an application interface where users can upload or capture food images.
Display the recognized food items and estimated calories to the user.
Implement a feedback loop where user corrections can be used to improve the model over time.
